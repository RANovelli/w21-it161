            <h2 class="subheader">Accessiblity</h2>
             <p>Web accessibility refers to the design of websites that are easily reached, entered, and used by those with disabilities, whether those disabilities are permanent, temporary, or situational. Web accessibility not only benefits your business’s bottom line, but it can also potentially prevent legal action while boosting public favor and reputation.</p> 

             <p>Web accessibility is extremely important in the implementation and success of any business, especially small businesses, in today’s market. A key factor of web accessibility is that a business has the potential to reach an entirely new customer base, which may have been completely overlooked by the competition, thus increasing profitability. According to the Bureau of Internet Accessibility (BoIA), “Disabilities come in many different forms, including hearing disabilities, visual disabilities, motor disabilities, and cognitive disabilities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1 in 4 U.S. adults is living with a disability. Businesses and organizations should therefore ignore this segment of the population at their peril. According to the Click-Away Pound survey, UK retailers lost an estimated £11.75 billion ($15.5 billion) in 2016 because people with disabilities were unable to purchase their products online” (BoIA). Adley Reed, from AW2K (awebtoknow.com), echoes this, saying, “Almost 15% of the world’s population has disabilities. In the US alone, consumers with disabilities spend over $200 billion each year in discretionary spending. 54% of these consumers spend that money online. In short, ignoring these individuals will likely lose your potential and current customers. However, becoming compliant will ensure that you gain their business, increasing sales” (Reed).</p>

             <p>Not to mention, failing to comply with accessibility guidelines can result in legal repercussions. According to David Gevorkian of the Score blog, “The Web is considered a public accommodation and thus obliged to comply with the ADA standards. Even though no pertinent regulations are covering ADA web accessibility, federal courts ruled that website accessibility falls within the spirit of ADA by lessening commerce and business barriers for individuals with disabilities. In several cases, the courts have ruled that websites fall under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and thereby interpreted as a place of public accommodation” (Gevorkian). In layman’s terms, this means if your website is not easily accessible to everyone, you may find yourself with a discrimination lawsuit on your hands.</p> 

             <p>Finally, web accessibility can ultimately boost the following and favor for your brand, especially in today’s market. BoIA presents this interesting statement, “In this era of digital activism, many consumers want to support companies that share their beliefs, ideals, and values. According to a recent survey by Accenture Strategy, 62 percent of consumers prefer to make purchases from a brand that is willing to take a stand on issues that matter. What’s more, 47 percent are willing to walk away if they are disappointed with a company’s words or actions, and 17 percent will not return” (BoIA).</p>

             <p>In conclusion, taking appropriate steps towards website accessibility is the best practice for ethical, profitable, and sustainable business as eCommerce continues to expand, for the foreseeable future.</p>
