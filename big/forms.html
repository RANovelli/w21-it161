            <h2 class="subheader">Forms</h2>
             <p>Web forms are an important tool and one of the main points of contact between a user and a website or application. Making sure your web forms are easy to navigate and informative is a vital step to building a good relationship with a potential client. Maneet Puri on the Usabilla blog asserts, “There are many aspects of your website that contribute to the overall user experience. A web form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a cordial relation with them. The time you spent in bringing the user to your website should be complemented with the time spent in perfecting the user experience, including your web forms” (Puri).</p> 

             <p>The most important function of a web form is that it is easy to use. Today, a vast majority of users are accessing forms from their mobile devices, and it is essential to make sure these transactions go smoothly. Stephanie Walter from SmashingMagazine.com says, concerning this, “To build better forms, you first need to take a few steps away from your database’s structure. Try to understand how users want to fill in forms. This is where doing some usability testing and user research on your forms becomes handy. User mental models is a UX concept that can help you with that. Nielsen Norman Group describes it as ‘what the user believes about the system at hand.’ Ask your tester to think aloud and tell you how they would fill the form. Which steps do they expect? What comes first? What comes next? This will give you a better idea of how to structure your form in a more user-friendly way” (Walter).</p>

             <p>Using the correct structure when building an HTML form will help ensure that the form is both usable and accessible. This refers to using tags and elements effectively in conjunction to optimize the user experience. Input fields should be easily recognizable, buttons should look like buttons, error messages and other prompts should inform and guide users along. Justin Mifsud from SmashingMagazine.com puts it this way, “When using a website, users have a particular goal. If designed well, the website will meet that goal and align it with the goals of the organization behind the website. Standing between the user’s goal and the organization’s goals is very often a form, because, despite the advances in human-computer interaction, forms remain the predominant form of interaction for users on the Web. In fact, forms are often considered to be the last and most important stage of the journey to the completion of goals” (Mifsud).</p>
